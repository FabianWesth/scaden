## Single-cell assisted deconvolutional network

Scaden is a deep-learning based algorithm for cell type deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq samples. It was developed 
at the DZNE TÃ¼bingen and the ZMNH in Hamburg. Please check out the [documentation](https://scaden.readthedocs.io) for further information.
A pre-print describing the method is available at Biorxiv: [Deep-learning based cell composition analysis from tissue expression profiles](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/659227v1)
