## Single-cell assisted deconvolutional network

Scaden is a deep-learning based algorithm for cell type deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq samples. It was developed 
at the DZNE TÃ¼bingen and the ZMNH in Hamburg. 
The method is published in Science Advances:
 [Deep-learning based cell composition analysis from tissue expression profiles](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/30/eaba2619)

A complete documentation is available [here](https://scaden.readthedocs.io)

to deconvolve complex bulk mixtures.

### 1. System requirements
Scaden was developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04). It was not tested on Windows or Mac, but should
also be usable on these systems when installing with Pip or Bioconda. Scaden does not require any special
hardware (e.g. GPU), however we recommend to have at least 16 GB of memory.

Scaden requires Python 3. All package dependencies should be handled automatically when installing with pip or conda.

### 2. Installation guide
Scaden can be easily installed on a Linux system, and should also work on Mac. 
There are currently two options for installing Scaden, either using [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) or via [pip](https://pypi.org/).

## pip
To install Scaden via pip, simply run the following command:

`pip install scaden`


## Bioconda
You can also install Scaden via bioconda, using:

`conda install -c bioconda scaden`

## GPU
If you want to make use of your GPU, you will have to additionally install `tensorflow-gpu`.

For pip:

`pip install tensorflow-gpu`

For conda:

`conda install tensorflow-gpu`

## Docker
If you don't want to install Scaden at all, but rather use a Docker container, we provide that as well.
For every release, we provide two version - one for CPU and one for GPU usage.
To pull the CPU container, use this command:

`docker pull ghcr.io/kevinmenden/scaden/scaden`

For the GPU container:

`docker pull ghcr.io/kevinmenden/scaden/scaden-gpu`

### Webtool (beta)
Additionally, we now proivde a web tool:

[https://scaden.ims.bio](https://scaden.ims.bio)

It contains pre-generated training datasets for several tissues, and all you need to do is to upload your expression data. Please note that this is still in preview.

### 3. Demo
We provide several curated [training datasets](https://scaden.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets/) for Scaden. For this demo,
we will use the human PBMC training dataset, which consists of 4 different scRNA-seq datasets and 32,000 samples in total.
You can download it here:
[https://figshare.com/s/e59a03885ec4c4d8153f](https://figshare.com/s/e59a03885ec4c4d8153f).

For this demo, you will also need to download some test samples to perform deconvolution on, along with their associated labels.
You can download the data we used for the Scaden paper here:
[https://figshare.com/articles/Publication_Figures/8234030](https://figshare.com/articles/Publication_Figures/8234030)

We'll perform deconvolution on simulated samples from the data6k dataset. You can find the samples and labels in 'paper_data/figures/figure2/data/data6k_500_*'
once you have downloaded this data from the link mentioned above.

The first step is to perform preprocessing on the training data. This is done with the following command:

`scaden process pbmc_data.h5ad paper_data/figures/figure2/data/data6k_500_samples.txt`

This will generate a file called 'processed.h5ad', which we will use for training. The training data
we have downloaded also contains samples from the data6k scRNA-seq dataset, so we have to exclude them from training
to get a meaningfull test of Scaden's performance. The following command will train a Scaden ensemble for 5000 steps per model (recommended),
and store it in 'scaden_model'. Data from the data6k dataset will be excluded from training. Depending on your machine, this can take about 10-20 minutes.

`scaden train processed.h5ad --steps 5000 --model_dir scaden_model --train_datasets 'data8k donorA donorC'`

Finally, we can perform deconvolution on the 500 simulates samples from the data6k dataset:

`scaden predict paper_data/figures/figure2/data/data6k_500_samples.txt --model_dir scaden_model`

This will create a file named 'cdn_predictions.txt' (will be renamed in future version to 'scaden_predictions.txt'), which contains
the deconvolution results. You can now compare these predictions with the true values contained in 
'paper_data/figures/figure2/data/data6k_500_labels.txt'. This should give you the same results as we obtained in the Scaden paper
(see Figure 2).
