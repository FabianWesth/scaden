# Usage

For a typical deconvolution with Scaden you will have to perform three steps:

* pre-processing of training data
* training of Scaden model
* prediction

This assumes that you already have a training data file. If not, you will have to create one, as explained in a later section.

## Pre-processing
`scaden process <training data> <prediction data>`

## Training
`scaden train <processed data>`


## Prediction 
`scaden predict <prediction file>`



## Training data generation
